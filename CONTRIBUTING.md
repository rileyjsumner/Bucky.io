Contributing
============
A simple guide to changing this project

Getting Started
---------------
1. After cloning the repository, create a new branch for the changes you wish to make.
2. The branch should follow the naming convention `username-changetitle`, ie `rileyjsumner-login-enhancements`
3. The branch will be deleted after the pr is confirmed
4. Thouroughly detail changes that are made. If new methods are added, include javadoc compliant with our [documentation standards](DOCUMENTATION.md)
5. If methods are modified append a new paragraph to the existing java documentation with a `@version` with the most recent release
6. Happy Contributing!
