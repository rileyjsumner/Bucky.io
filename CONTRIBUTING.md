<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
    <li>After cloning the repository, create a new branch for the changes you wish to make.</li>
    <li>The branch should follow the naming convention `username-changetitle`, ie `rileyjsumner-login-enhancements`</li>
    <li>The branch will be deleted after the pr is confirmed</li>
    <li>Thouroughly detail changes that are made. If new methods are added, include javadoc compliant with our documentation standards(link)</li 
    <li>If methods are modified append a new paragraph to the existing java documentation with a `@version` with the most recent release</li>
    <li>Happy Contributing!</li>
